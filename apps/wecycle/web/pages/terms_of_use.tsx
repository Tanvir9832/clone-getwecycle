          Homezz does not sell or otherwise provide Pro Services. Homezz may
          directly provide home project consultations and related on-Platform
          services to Consumers, but any Pro Services solicited as a result of
          any such consultations or on-Platform services are provided by an
          independent Service Professional without any representation or
          warranty from Homezz other than as expressly provided for herein.
          Homezz also facilitates Pro Service transactions, which facilitation
          may include displaying a list of Service Professionals profiles,
          allowing Consumers and Service Professionals to send messages to each
          other, allowing for the booking of an appointment for the provision of
          Pro Services, assisting in the selection of a Service Professional for
          certain Consumers, and processing payment for certain Pro Services.
          Consumers understand that any such facilitation does not constitute a
          warranty in relation to the Pro Services. Service Professionals
          understand and agree that using the Platform does not guarantee that

          any Pro Services they solicit and/or pay for using the Platform are
          solicited directly from the Service Professional providing such Pro

          they provide their own equipment, select their own jobs, develop their
          own expertise, are free to do jobs through other platforms and lead
          sources, and determine their own work schedule. Homezz does not
          control, and has no right to control, the services a Service
          Professional provides (including the details of how the Service
          Professional provides such services) if the Service Professional is

          suspend, deactivate, or cancel a Service Professional’s account based

        <h2>HOMEZZ BUDGET, FEES, AND TAXES</h2>
        <p className="my-3">
          In connection with the use of Homezz's Platform, Homezz charges Fees.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          Service Professionals can pay Fees to Homezz in order to receive
          certain services on the Platform, including but not limited to
          receiving contacts, bookings or payments from Consumers or other
          individuals. As a Service Professional, Homezz will automatically
          charge your stored payment method when those Consumers or other
          individuals contact you or make a booking with you concerning a Pro
          Service that matches the targeting preferences you set with us. Homezz
          may also charge other types of Fees that you have previously agreed to
          (for example, cancellation fees or fees for services such as Front
          Desk) to your stored payment method or as deduction from your Homezz
          balance. Fees may also be deducted from the total amount a Consumer
          pays for a particular Pro Service. In order to use Homezz, you must
          have at least one valid payment method stored on file and the storage
          of such payment method is subject to our
          <a
            className="text-blue-500 mx-2 no-underline"
            href="https://homezz.co/"
          >
            Stored Payment Terms and Conditions
          </a>
          . As described more fully below, you may also be required to set a
          weekly spending limit or Budget (as defined below). Except as
          otherwise described herein or in our
          <a
            className="text-blue-500 mx-2 no-underline"
            href="https://homezz.co/"
          >
            Refund Policy
          </a>
          , all sales and Fees on Homezz are final and non-refundable.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          <i>Budget for Service Professionals</i>
          As a Service Professional, Homezz may require you to set one or more
          weekly spending limits (“Budgets”) for how much you are willing to
          spend on certain Fees over a specific period (“Budget Period”). The
          types of leads or other Fees that count against your Budget will be
          disclosed to you at the time you set your Budget. You understand that
          Homezz may charge your stored payment method in excess of your Budgets
          if such charges relate to Fees not covered by your budget (including
          for “opportunities” contacts or for commission-based Fees), or if you
          otherwise give Homezz permission to do so. You will not be charged the
          Budget amount upfront or automatically - your Budget is not a
          subscription. Rather, you will be charged Fees (as further described
          below) and the types of Fees covered by a Budget will not exceed your
          specified Budget without your permission. While Homezz may provide an
          estimate for the number of Consumers who may contact you if you set a
          particular Budget for a particular Budget Period, or if you otherwise
          set a certain spending preference, you acknowledge and agree that any
          such estimate is not a guarantee, that Homezz does not and cannot
          control any Consumer or other individual’s interest in contacting or
          hiring you, and that actual results will vary.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          We will identify the length of the Budget Period when you set your
          Budget. The length of the Budget Period will not change within a given
          Budget Period but may be changed for subsequent Budget Periods. If a
          Budget Period length changes, you can adjust your Budget. If you do
          not do so, Homezz will automatically pro-rate your then-current Budget
          to the length of the new period. For example, if you indicate you are
          willing to spend $100 for a one-week Budget Period, the Budget Period
          shifts to two weeks, and you do not make changes manually, your Budget
          will automatically be adjusted to $200 for the two-week Budget Period.
          You can change your Budget for a Budget Period at any time, including
          in the middle of a Budget Period, subject to the terms of this
          paragraph and what you have already spent. If you do not change your
          Budget in advance of a subsequent Budget Period, your Budget from the
          then-current Budget Period will automatically be used for that
          subsequent Budget Period, subject to the foregoing.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          <i>Timing of Charges for Service Professionals on Homezz.</i>
          As a Service Professional using Homezz, there are different points at
          which your payment method may be charged:
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          If You Lack Sufficient Purchasing History on Homezz
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          If you are new to Homezz or do not have a sufficient purchasing
          history on the Platform as determined in Homezz’s sole and absolute
          discretion, your payment method may be charged each time you are
          contacted or booked by a Consumer or other individual and you do not
          have an adequate Homezz balance to cover the cost of that contact.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          If You Have a Sufficient Purchasing History On Homezz
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          Once Homezz determines, in our sole and absolute discretion, that you
          have sufficient purchasing history on Homezz, Homezz may charge your
          payment method periodically for the total Fees accrued when Consumers
          or other individuals contact you. Specifically, Homezz may charge your
          payment method each time (a) a specific time period has passed; and/or
          (b) within that time period, each time the total Fees accrued hit a
          certain dollar threshold. The frequency of charges may not match the
          Budget Period described above. Homezz may adjust both the specific
          time period and the dollar threshold that trigger charges in our sole
          and absolute discretion. Homezz may also, in our sole and absolute
          discretion, revert to charging your payment method each time you{' '}
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          are contacted by a Consumer or other individual and you do not have an
          adequate Homezz balance to cover the cost of that contact.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          Homezz may offer certain services or features with payment timing that
          differs from, or is not applicable to, the above.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          <i>Default Payment Method.</i>
          For ordinary charges from Service Professionals, Homezz will first
          attempt to charge the default payment method. In the event that Homezz
          is unable to charge that payment method for any reason--including but
          not limited to exceeding a payment method’s credit limit, payment
          method cancellation, a payment method being out of date, or payment
          method details being incorrect--you agree that Homezz may charge any
          other payment method associated with your account and take any other
          action to collect payment from you. If your payment details change,
          your card provider may provide us with updated card details. We may
          use these new details in order to help prevent any interruption to the
          Pro Services. If Homezz is unable to charge the default payment
          method, Homezz may attempt to charge any other payment methods
          associated with your Account in any order.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          <i>Penalty Fees for All Users.</i>
          Homezz may also charge penalty Fees for fraud, misconduct, late
          payment or other violations of these Terms, as determined in our sole
          discretion. Information about current penalty Fees is available in the
          help center.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          In addition, Homezz may charge certain penalty Fees disclosed directly
          in the Platform, including cancellation Fees.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          You agree to pay all applicable Fees or charges based on the Fee and
          billing terms then in effect, regardless of whether you have an active
          Account. Charges will be made to the payment method designated at the
          time you accrue a Fee. If you do not pay on time or if Homezz cannot
          charge a payment method for any reason, Homezz reserves all rights
          permissible under law to recover payment plus all costs and expenses
          incurred, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in our pursuit of
          payment. If any Fee is not paid in a timely manner, or we are unable
          to process your transaction using the payment method provided, we
          reserve the right to terminate or suspend your Account.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          You explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent
          accounts or Fees due will be made by electronic mail or by phone. You
          agree that all notices, disclosures, and other communications that we
          provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
          communications be in writing. You agree that you have the ability to
          store such electronic communications such that they remain accessible
          to you in an unchanged form. You agree to keep your contact
          information current, including but not limited to your email address
          and phone number. Such communication may be made by Homezz or by
          anyone on our behalf, including but not limited to a third-party
          collection agent. If you cancel your Account at any time, you will not
          receive any refund. If you have a balance due on your Account, you
          agree that Homezz may charge such unpaid Fees to any payment method or
          otherwise bill you for such unpaid Fees.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          <i>Taxes</i>
          Payments required by these Terms may be stated exclusive of all taxes,
          duties, levies, imposts, fines or similar governmental assessments,
          including sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, goods and services
          taxes, excise, business, service, and similar transactional taxes
          imposed by any jurisdiction and the interest and penalties thereon
          (collectively, “Taxes”). Certain jurisdictions, however, may require
          us to collect Taxes from you in connection with the purchase of,
          payment for, access to, facilitation of or use of the Pro Services,
          and you will be responsible for and bear Taxes associated with the
          purchase of, payment for, access to, or use of the Pro Services.
          Charges are inclusive of applicable Taxes where required by law. You
          hereby confirm that Homezz can determine your appropriate jurisdiction
          for tax purposes however it deems appropriate or as required by law,
          and you agree to pay taxes to Homezz when Homezz includes a charge for
          taxes on any invoice. You also understand and agree that you are
          solely responsible for determining your own tax reporting and sales
          and use tax collection requirements in consultation with your own tax
          advisers, and that we cannot and do not offer specific tax advice to
          either Service Professionals or Consumers.

        <h2>TRACKING COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
        <p className="my-3">
          In order to ensure appropriate charging of Fees and compliance with
          these Terms, Homezz may track the occurrence of communications between
          Consumers and Service Professionals that occur off of the Platform via
          email, phone call, SMS text message, third-party websites, or any
          other means, whether initiated by a Consumer or Service Professional.
          In order to track the occurrence of such communications, Homezz may
          obscure Service Professional contact information in a Service
          Professional profile, replace Service Professional contact information
          in a Service Professional profile with a different piece of contact
          information that will forward to the Service Professional, or take any
          other step reasonably calculated to track the occurrence of such
          communications. Except as explicitly stated herein, we will not record
          or review the content of any communications that do not come into
          contact with the Homezz Platform unless we first obtain your
          permission.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          If you send text messages with a Consumer or Service Professional
          using the telephone number for that User available on the Platform, we
          may use a third-party service provider to track these text messages.
          We track these text messages for fraud prevention, to ensure
          appropriate charging of Fees, to enforce these Terms, and for quality
          and training purposes. As part of this process, Homezz and our service
          provider will receive in real time and store data about your text
          message, including the date and time of the text message, your phone
          number, and the content of the text message.

        <h2>HOMEZZ PLUS</h2>
        <p className="my-3">
          Homezz Plus is a subscription-based, online service available to
          certain Consumers. If you subscribe to Homezz Plus and your account is
          fully-paid and in good standing, you are eligible to receive benefits
          outlined

          , which may change at any time. At the end of your Homezz Plus
          subscription, your subscription will automatically renew for periods
          of the same length as your original subscription unless you opt-out at
          least five business days prior to such automatic renewal by providing
          notice to Homezz by choosing “turn off auto-renew” option on your
          Homezz Plus membership page or by contacting Homezz customer service.
          Homezz may choose to discontinue the Homezz Plus service at any time,
          in which case subscribers will be refunded a prorated amount of their
          subscription fee based on the portion of your subscription that has
          elapsed to that point. Subscribers may cancel their subscription at
          any time, but the subscription fee is nonrefundable. Homezz Plus is
          available to consumer households only. Businesses, property managers,
          landlords and other similar persons may not utilize Homezz Plus and
          any attempt to do so will disqualify them from the Homezz Plus
          benefits. Homezz Plus subscriptions are subject to these Terms and any
          information you share in connection therewith is subject to the
          Privacy Policy. You understand that if you violate the Terms, Homezz
          may terminate your Homezz Plus subscription without any refund of your
          Homezz Plus subscription fee or otherwise.

          Service Professionals (“Marketplace Payments”) through our payment
          processing partner Stripe, but Homezz is not a party to any such
          Marketplace Payments or any Pro Services related thereto. Unless
          otherwise indicated, Marketplace Payments may be made for services
          only; Marketplace Payments for tangible personal property is
          prohibited. By agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as a
          Service Professional on the Platform, you hereby appoint Homezz to act
          as your agent for the limited purpose of facilitating and receiving
          Marketplace Payments on your behalf through Stripe as contemplated
          herein. You acknowledge and agree that, subject to any rights you have
          pertaining to Marketplace Payment disputes, once a Marketplace Payment
          has been made through the Homezz Platform, the payment obligation of
          the payor User shall be deemed satisfied by the payee User upon
          receipt of the Marketplace Payment by Homezz as though the payor User
          had made the Marketplace Payment directly to the payee User.

          Homezz does not offer any professional services directly or indirectly
          unless specified in a separate contract to which Homezz is a direct
          party. Any time a Consumer pays for or books Pro Services on the
          Platform or receives a quote in connection with Pro Services, such
          Consumer is contracting directly with the Service Professional
          offering such Pro Service.
          <strong>
            Notwithstanding any facilitation of booking or payment, you
            understand and agree that Homezz (i) does not sell, offer, provide
            or subcontract any Pro Service and (ii) is not liable in any way for
            any Pro Service, except to the extent expressly set forth in the

            marketplace only, not in a role of provider of Pro Services).
          </strong>
          Notwithstanding Homezz’s role as a payment facilitator, each Service
          Professional who receives Marketplace Payments understands and agrees
          that they are obligated to perform the Pro Service as outlined in
          their agreement with the Consumer and work to remedy any material
          deviations from such contract.

            Stripe Services Agreement
          </a>
          . Service Professionals should never agree to receive a Marketplace
          Payment, or perform services in expectation thereof, before they have
          confirmed that they can comply with such Stripe agreements and, in
          particular, Service Professionals should note that they will need a
          social security number or employer identification number in order to
          receive Marketplace Payments. As a Service Professional, by agreeing
          to these terms or continuing to operate as a Service Professional on
          Homezz, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Connected Account
          Agreement and Stripe Services Agreement, as those agreements may be
          modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of receiving
          payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide
          Homezz with accurate and complete information about you and your
          business, and you authorize Homezz to share this information and
          transaction information related to your use of the payment processing
          services provided by Stripe. Service Professionals also agree that
          Homezz may debit their Stripe account in connection with disputes with
          Consumers. Homezz reserves the right to process such debits and to
          withhold final payments until Homezz has investigated disputes. Homezz
          may make a final decision on disputes in their sole discretion and, as
          a Service Professional, you understand that all Marketplace Payments
          you may earn on the Platform are subject to such decisions.
          Additionally, Service Professionals agree that Homezz may reverse
          payments that have been made to a Service Professional’s Stripe
          Connected Account when a customer refund or guarantee payout is
          warranted, including in connection with such Service Professional’s
          actions or inactions that are prohibited by these Terms.

          As a Consumer making a Marketplace Payment through Stripe, you agree
          to pay all amounts you owe when due using your preferred payment

          method for amounts you owe when they are due, whether they are
          recurring or one-time payments. You must keep all payment information
          you provide us up-to-date, accurate and complete. When you store a

          information, but we expressly disclaim any liability to you, and you

          Homezz may enable you to make Marketplace Payments using credit,

          payment method we support. We reserve the right to cancel your ability
          to make payments with one or more of the payment methods you have
          authorized in our sole and absolute discretion.

        <p className="my-3">
          If you choose your bank account as your Marketplace Payment method,
          you authorize Stripe to make Automated Clearing House (“ACH”)
          withdrawals from your bank account, and to make any inquiries we
          consider necessary to validate any dispute involving payments you make
          to us or to a User, which may include ordering a credit report and
          performing other credit checks or verifying the information you
          provide us against third-party databases. You authorize Homezz or our
          provider to initiate one or more ACH debit entries (withdrawals) or
          the creation of an equivalent bank draft for the specified amount(s)
          from your bank account, and you authorize the financial institution
          that holds your bank account to deduct such payments. You also
          authorize the bank that holds your bank account to deduct any such
          payments in the amounts and frequency designated in your Account. Your
          authorization will remain in effect until canceled in writing by you.
          You agree to notify us of any changes to your account information or
          termination of your authorization at least five days prior to your
          next payment.

        <p className="my-3">
          If your full payment is not processed by us at the same time, you
          hereby authorize partial debits from your bank account, not to exceed
          the total amount of your order. You agree to pay any ACH fees or fines
          you or we incur associated with transactions you authorize. This
          return fee will vary based on which state you are located in. The
          return fee may be added to your payment amount and debited from your
          bank account if we resubmit an ACH debit due to insufficient funds. We
          may initiate a collection process or legal action to collect any money
          owed to us. You agree to pay all our costs for such action, including
          any reasonable attorneys' fees. Federal law limits your liability for
          any fraudulent, erroneous, or unauthorized transactions from your bank
          account based on how quickly you report it to your financial
          institution. You must report any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized
          transactions to your bank no more than 60 days after the disputed
          transaction appeared on your bank account statement. Please contact
          your bank for more information about the policies and procedures that
          apply unauthorized transactions and the limits on your liability.

          owed. We will attempt to pay you any Payment Disputed amounts you are
          owed using the method with which you made the disputed payment, but we
          cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so if your payment method
          information is inaccurate, incomplete, or has been canceled.

          PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS,
          INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
        </h3>
        <p className="my-3">
          You and Homezz agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and
          that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
          enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and
          all disputes between you and Homezz, including but not limited to
          claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship
          between you and Homezz, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
          fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose
          before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not
          limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise
          after the termination of this Agreement. The only disputes excluded
          from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual
          property and small court claims, as provided below.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes
          with Homezz as follows:
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          <i>Initial Dispute Resolution: </i>
          Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can

          . Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the
          parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim,
          question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the
          Homezz support department, and good faith negotiations will be a
          condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          <i>Binding Arbitration: </i>
          If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of
          thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is
          initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then
          either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to
          resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically,
          all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or previous
          versions of these Terms (including the Terms' or Privacy Policy's
          formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with
          each other, and/or your use of the Platform will be finally settled by
          binding arbitration, as described below.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          Where the relief sought by you is $10,000.99 or less and you do not
          wish to bring the claim in small claims court, the arbitration will be
          conducted online by an online arbitration provider of our choosing in
          accordance with their applicable arbitration rules & procedures
          effective at the time a claim is made. Currently, you may initiate

        <p className="my-3">
          Where the relief sought is $10,001.00 or more, resolution will be in
          accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for
          claims that do not exceed $250,000.00 and the JAMS Comprehensive
          Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000.00 in
          effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules
          or procedures governing or permitting class actions. To initiate an
          arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand
          for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the
          amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand
          for Arbitration at{' '}

          </a>{' '}
          ); (b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the
          appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500,
          San Francisco, California 94111; and (c) send one copy of the Demand
          for Arbitration to Homezz at 415 Natoma Street, Suite 1300, San
          Francisco, California 94103, ATTN: Legal. You will be required to pay
          $250 to initiate an arbitration against us. If the arbitrator finds
          the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Homezz will pay all other fees
          invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing
          expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the
          arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency,
          will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of
          or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or
          formation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including but not
          limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy
          Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration,
          or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator will
          be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court
          under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award will be written and
          will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any
          court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration
          provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury
          trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of
          arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to
          discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place
          in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals
          residing outside the United States, arbitration will be initiated in
          the state of California, United States. You and Homezz further agree
          to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court
          in San Francisco County, California in order to compel arbitration, to
          stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate,
          or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          <i>Class Action Waiver</i>
          The parties further agree that the arbitration will be conducted in
          their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other
          representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to
          file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND HOMEZZ
          AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR
          INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
          PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or
          arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this
          paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an
          arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration
          provisions set forth above will be deemed null and void in their
          entirety and the parties will be deemed to have not agreed to
          arbitrate disputes.

            Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims
            Court Claims:
          </i>
          Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through
          arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity
          determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or
          unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or
          in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect your or our
          intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means
          patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, trade dress, and trade
          secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also
          seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the
          scope of that court's jurisdiction.

          You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and

          The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the later of the
          Effective Date of these Terms or your first use of the Platform;
          otherwise, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with
          the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration
          provisions, Homezz also will not be bound by them.

          <i>Changes to This Section:</i>
          Homezz will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes affecting
          the substance of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section by
          posting on the Homezz Terms of Use website, sending you a message, or
          otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account.
          Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are
          posted on the Homezz Terms of Use website or sent to you.

          Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to
          claims arising after the 30th day. If a court or arbitrator decides
          that this subsection on "Changes to This Section" is not enforceable
          or valid, then this subsection will be severed from the section
          entitled “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or
          arbitrator will apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
          section in existence after you began using the Platform.

          <i>Third-Party Beneficiary:</i>
          Third-Party Beneficiary: You and Homezz acknowledge that any
          third-party consumer reporting agency that Homezz uses to perform
          background checks on Service Professionals is an express and intended
          third-party beneficiary of this arbitration provision and as such, the
          terms of this Arbitration provision will inure to the benefit of the
          consumer reporting agencies and may be enforced by them. Accordingly,
          you agree that any dispute that arises between you and a consumer
          reporting agency that relates to or arises out of this Agreement or
          any aspect of your relationship with Homezz will be resolved by
          binding arbitration. If any court or arbitrator determines that this
          third-party beneficiary subsection is void or unenforceable for any
          reason, then this subsection will be severed from the section entitled
          “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the remainder of the
          section will remain enforceable, meaning that the class action waiver
          and the mutual obligation to resolve disputes between you and Homezz
          through binding arbitration remains enforceable.
