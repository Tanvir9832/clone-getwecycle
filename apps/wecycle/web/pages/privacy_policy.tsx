          We may collect information about you through Homezz affiliates or
          through non-affiliated sources, including public information sources.
          For example:
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be able to access the Platform through a social networking
          account, such as Facebook. If you access the Platform through your

          information in your Facebook profile. This may include your name,
          profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends,
          location, date of birth, email address, photos, videos, people you
          follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or "likes." Social
          networking sites, such as Facebook, have their own policies for
          handling your information. For a description of how these sites may
          use and disclose your information, including any information you make
          public, please consult those sites' privacy policies.

          To the extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole discretion, ask
          for and collect supplemental information about you from non-affiliated
          sources, such as information about your credit from a credit bureau,
          or information to verify your identity or trustworthiness, or for
          other fraud or safety protection purposes. We may combine information
          that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we
          obtain from such sources, including public information sources and
          information derived from any other products or services we provide.

          We may collect information that demonstrates the occurrence of an
          off-Platform communication between a Consumer and a Service
          Professional in order to ensure accurate charging of fees imposed upon
          Service Professionals and to enforce the Terms of Use. Except as
          explicitly stated herein, we will not collect or store the contents of
          any off-Platform communication between a Consumer and a Service
          Professional.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you send text messages with a Consumer or Service Professional
          using the telephone number for that User available on the Platform, we
          may use a third-party vendor to track these text messages. We track
          these text messages for fraud prevention, to ensure appropriate
          charging of fees, to enforce our Terms of Use, and for quality and
          training purposes. As part of this process, Homezz and the third-party
          vendor will receive in real time and store data about your text
          message, including the date and time of the text message, your phone
          number, and the content of the text message.

        <p className="my-3">
          When you use the Platform, we may collect general location information
          (such as your location as derived from your IP address). If you
          install our mobile app, depending on your device settings and any
          permissions you have granted, we may collect information about your
          precise geolocation, and we may use that information to improve the
          Platform, including providing you with location-based features (e.g.,
          for identification of Pro Services available near you). To deliver
          customized content and advertising, we may disclose your location
          information to our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access the
          Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to
          provide us with location-tracking information, you may be able to
          disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device.
          See your device manufacturer's instructions for further details. If
          you disable certain functions, you may be unable to use certain parts

          technologies that help us better understand User behavior, personalize
          preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Platform.
          These technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Platform
          to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track
          the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics
          about Platform usage. We also use certain of these technologies to
          deliver advertisements through the Platform that may interest you or
          to advertise ourselves and the Platform to you on other sites. We or
          our third-party vendors also may use certain of these technologies in
          emails to our Users to help us track email response rates, identify
          when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are
          forwarded.

          considered “sales” under the CCPA. Homezz also discloses Consumers’
          identifiers (like name) and general location information (like zip
          code) to select Service Professionals to better enable those Consumers
          to find a Service Professional who can provide a service the Consumer
          has expressed interest in. Under the CCPA, these may be considered
          “sales” of your personal information. “Sharing” personal information.
          Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising
          to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained
          from the consumer’s activity across websites. We “share” information
          for these purposes to provide more relevant and tailored advertising
